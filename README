aciCarousel - Cross-browser carousels with jQuery

Features of aciCarousel include:

- roll in any direction with a element or to a element index or to a element inside carousel list (using a jQuery selector or passing a jQuery object);

- supports callback functions where you can apply different effects to the selected element, the one losing the selection at a time and for the elements at the edge of the visible area 
who fade-in/fade-out from view (fade-in/fade-out effects are implemented by default);

- supports the use of a custom HTML structure by specifying different init options;

- supports callback functions run at the beginning and end of animations so it allows synchronization with other items/effects on the page or which may cause certain actions.

Simple usage:

$().ready(function(){

    $('.carousel').aciCarousel();

});

Check the example to learn how to use it and how you can implement the callback functions
to roll out your own element effects.

Note: There is a limitation in the current version where you need a number of elements at
least equal with the number of visible ones at a time.
